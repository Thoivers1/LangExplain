Evaluate the double integral: integral from 0 to 2 of (integral from 0 to 3 of (2x + y) dx) dy


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

To evaluate the given double integral, we first integrate with respect to x, then with respect to y. 

The inner integral is ∫ from 0 to 3 (2x + y) dx. 

To integrate this with respect to x, we treat y as a constant. The integral of 2x with respect to x is x^2, and the integral of y with respect to x is yx, because y is treated as a constant.

So, ∫ from 0 to 3 (2x + y) dx = [x^2 + yx] evaluated from 0 to 3 = [3^2 + 3y] - [0] = 9 + 3y.

Now, we have the outer integral left to evaluate: ∫ from 0 to 2 (9 + 3y) dy. 

The integral of 9 with respect to y is 9y, and the integral of 3y with respect to y is (3/2)y^2.

So, ∫ from 0 to 2 (9 + 3y) dy = [9y + (3/2)y^2] evaluated from 0 to 2 = [18 + 6] - [0] = 24.

So, the value of the double integral ∫ from 0 to 2 ∫ from 0 to 3 (2x + y) dx dy is 24.

 As the Explainer, I will provide a detailed analysis of the double integral evaluated by the {assistant_role_name}. The assistant provided a correct answer of 24 for the value of the double integral.
To evaluate the double integral, the assistant first integrated with respect to x, then with respect to y. The inner integral is ∫ from 0 to 3 (2x + y) dx, which can be evaluated by treating y as a constant and integrating with respect to x. The result is [x^2 + yx] evaluated from 0 to 3, which equals 9 + 3y.
Next, the assistant integrated the outer integral, which is ∫ from 0 to 2 (9 + 3y) dy. This integral can be evaluated by integrating 9y and (3/2)y^2 with respect to y. The result is [18 + 6] - [0], which equals 24.
Overall, the assistant's reasoning and methodology were correct. They broke down the double integral into two integrals and evaluated them separately, which allowed them to arrive at the correct answer. However, there is a potential issue with the way the assistant handled the constant term in the inner integral. By treating y as a constant, the assistant lost the constant term in the integrand, which could have been accounted for by adjusting the limits of integration.
In conclusion, the {assistant_role_name} provided a correct answer for the value of the double integral, but could have handled the constant term more carefully. Overall, the assistant's reasoning and methodology were solid, and they demonstrated a good understanding of the concepts involved in evaluating double integrals.

What is the first step in solving this double integral?


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

The first step in solving this double integral is to solve the inner integral first, which is with respect to x. 

In this case, the inner integral is ∫ from 0 to 3 (2x + y) dx. 

To solve this, you would integrate the function 2x + y with respect to x, treating y as a constant. The integral of 2x with respect to x is x^2, and the integral of y with respect to x is yx, because y is treated as a constant.

So, ∫ from 0 to 3 (2x + y) dx = [x^2 + yx] evaluated from 0 to 3 = [3^2 + 3y] - [0] = 9 + 3y.

This result is then used in the outer integral for the next step.

What would happen if the limits of the integral were changed? How would it affect the result?


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

Changing the limits of the integral would change the region over which you are integrating, which would in turn change the result of the integral.

For a double integral, the limits of integration define a region in the xy-plane. If you change these limits, you are effectively changing the region over which you are calculating the volume under the surface defined by the function in the integral.

For example, if you were to change the limits of the outer integral from 0 to 2 to 0 to 1, you would be calculating the volume under the surface over a smaller region in the y-direction. This would likely result in a smaller value for the integral, assuming the function is non-negative over the region of integration.

Similarly, changing the limits of the inner integral would change the region of integration in the x-direction. Depending on the function and the new limits, this could increase or decrease the value of the integral.

In general, the effect of changing the limits of integration will depend on the specific function you are integrating and the new limits you choose.

What is the significance of the order of integration in a double integral? Does it matter if we integrate with respect to x first and then y, or vice versa?


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

The order of integration in a double integral can be significant. For some functions and regions, changing the order of integration can make the integral easier to compute. However, for rectangular regions and continuous functions, like in your example, the order of integration does not matter. 

In general, the order of integration matters when the limits of integration are functions of the other variable. For example, if you have a double integral where the limits of the x-integral are functions of y, you would need to integrate with respect to x first. If you tried to integrate with respect to y first, you would need to change the limits of integration, which can be a complex process known as changing the order of integration.

In your example, the limits of integration are constants, so you could integrate with respect to x first and then y, or vice versa, and you would get the same result. However, the computation might be easier one way or the other depending on the specific function you are integrating.

What is the geometric interpretation of a double integral?


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

The geometric interpretation of a double integral is that it represents the volume under a surface over a given region in the xy-plane.

More specifically, if you have a function f(x, y) that is defined over a region R in the xy-plane, the double integral of f(x, y) over the region R gives the volume of the solid that lies below the surface z = f(x, y), above the xy-plane, and within the region R.

This interpretation assumes that the function f(x, y) is non-negative over the region R. If the function takes on negative values, the integral could be interpreted as a "signed volume", where regions below the xy-plane subtract from the total.

In the context of physics and other sciences, double integrals can also be used to calculate quantities like mass, charge, and heat content, when these quantities are distributed continuously over a region.

What is the difference between a double integral and a single integral?


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

A single integral and a double integral are both mathematical operations used to calculate the area under a curve or the volume under a surface, respectively. However, they differ in the number of variables they integrate over and the type of result they provide.

1. Single Integral: A single integral, also known as a definite integral, is used to calculate the area under a curve in a two-dimensional space. It integrates a function of one variable over an interval on the real number line. For example, the integral ∫ from a to b f(x) dx gives the area under the curve y = f(x) from x = a to x = b.

2. Double Integral: A double integral extends the concept of a single integral to functions of two variables. It is used to calculate the volume under a surface in a three-dimensional space. It integrates a function of two variables over a region in the xy-plane. For example, the double integral ∫∫R f(x, y) dA, where R is a region in the xy-plane and dA represents an infinitesimal area element in the region R, gives the volume under the surface z = f(x, y) over the region R.

In summary, while a single integral deals with functions of one variable and calculates areas, a double integral deals with functions of two variables and calculates volumes.

What is the process of changing the order of integration in a double integral? How does it work?


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

Changing the order of integration in a double integral involves several steps and requires careful consideration of the region of integration. Here is a general process:

1. Identify the given region of integration: Look at the limits of integration and try to visualize or sketch the region in the xy-plane that they define.

2. Express the region in terms of the other variable: If the original integral is in the form ∫∫R f(x, y) dy dx, you need to express the region R in terms of x = g1(y) to x = g2(y). If the original integral is in the form ∫∫R f(x, y) dx dy, you need to express the region R in terms of y = h1(x) to y = h2(x).

3. Change the limits of integration: Replace the original limits of integration with the new ones that you found in step 2.

4. Change the order of integration: If the original integral was in the form ∫∫R f(x, y) dy dx, change it to ∫∫R f(x, y) dx dy, and vice versa.

5. Evaluate the integral: Now you can evaluate the integral in the usual way, by integrating first with respect to one variable and then with respect to the other.

Remember, changing the order of integration can sometimes make an integral easier to evaluate, but it can also make it more complicated, depending on the specific function and region. Always consider carefully whether changing the order of integration will be beneficial for a given problem.

What is the role of the function f(x, y) in a double integral?


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

In a double integral, the function f(x, y) represents the surface or the quantity that you are integrating over a certain region in the xy-plane.

Geometrically, if you are considering a double integral ∫∫R f(x, y) dA, where R is a region in the xy-plane and dA represents an infinitesimal area element in the region R, the function f(x, y) gives the height of the surface above each point (x, y) in the region R. The double integral then calculates the volume under the surface z = f(x, y) over the region R.

In applications, the function f(x, y) often represents a density or a rate of change. For example, in physics, f(x, y) could represent the mass density of a thin plate, in which case the double integral of f(x, y) over a region would give the total mass of the plate over that region. Similarly, in heat transfer, f(x, y) could represent the rate of heat generation in a region of a material, and the double integral of f(x, y) would give the total heat generated in that region.

What is the meaning of dA in the context of a double integral?


AI Assistant (AI assistant):

In the context of a double integral, dA represents a differential area element in the xy-plane. It's a small rectangle with sides dx and dy in the x and y directions, respectively. The area of this small rectangle is dx*dy, which is represented as dA.

When you're performing a double integral ∫∫R f(x, y) dA over a region R in the xy-plane, you're essentially adding up the contributions of the function f(x, y) over all such small rectangles in the region R. 

In Cartesian coordinates, dA is usually written as dx dy or dy dx, indicating that you first integrate with respect to one variable, then the other. The order of dx and dy depends on the order of integration. 

In other coordinate systems, like polar coordinates, dA can take other forms, like r dr dθ, reflecting the different geometry of the area elements in those systems.
